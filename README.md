# Gormandize - A restaurant analyzation web app

Gormandize allows you to enter a location and a search term (i.e. 'Pizza' or 'Sushi'), then searches both Yelp and Foursquare to gather information for a visualization across 3 charts. The result is a better way to view and compare restaurants based on ratings, average rating, and number of reviews.

Stack is Node.js, AngularJS, and Express.

Uses the Yelp + Foursquare + Google Maps APIs, Leaflet JS Maps, and amCharts (JS charts).
